 - In Lab:
    - BERT -> RNN
    - Create a Farsi text-cleaner
    - we have to choice (Transofrmers Lib, TFHub and Tokenazer Lib)
    - train BERT with ktrain

 - the Best language model for farsi:
    * Offical BERT multi-lang [here](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md)
