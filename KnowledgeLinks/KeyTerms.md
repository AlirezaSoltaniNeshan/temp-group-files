# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP is abbreviation of Natural Language Processing, concerns itself with the interaction between
natural human languages and computing devices, NLP is a major aspect of computational linguistics.

There are some important notes about that:

## Tokenization:
  Tokenization is really important level of NLP, because in this step we split longer String text into 
  smaller String text. Larger chunks of text can be tokenized into sentences, sentences can tokenized into words and etc...

## Normalization 
  Before any processing, text needs to be normalized, in NLP normalization has unique    explanation, Normalization describe series of related tasks meant to pull all text on a level playing field, that's mean converting all text to UPPER or lowe case or removing some punctuation or converting numbers to their words and so on. Normalization puts all words on equal footing, and allows processing to proceed uniformly.
  
  ## Stemming
   Stemming is the process of removing some affixes and suffixed (prefixes, infixes, circumfixes) from words in order to obtain a word stem (داشتن ریشه کلمه).
